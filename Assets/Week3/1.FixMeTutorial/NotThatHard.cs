/*
First I want to to create a new game object at World Zero and call it "WorldZero"

Then I want you to create a new game object and Add the Camera component to it. 
Next I want you to set the camera component clearFlags attribute to CameraClearFlags.SolidColor.
Then change the backgroundColor to blue;

Then I want you to create a new game object called "holder" at World Zero and then move it along the z axis 1 units;

Next I want you to create an array of gameObjects from from the Resources/Prefabs folder. This might need a unity API search
Then randomly select one to instaitate into the holder object. (This should be its own function)

Next make it so that whenever I press R it changes the gun that is displayed (you might have to destroy the older one first)

Now make the gun rotate
